#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
int num[] = {1,4,8,12,16};
int *p,*q;
int i;
p = num;
q = num+2;
i = *p++;
printf("%d, %d, %d\n",i, *p, *q);
}

Options:
a) 4, 4, 8
b) 1, 4, 8
c) 2, 1, 8
d) 2, 4, 8



Answer: b) 1, 4, 8

Explanation:
- at p=num, p will point to first element of num i.e. 1
- at q=num+2, q will point to third element of num i.e. 8
- at i=*p++, as * has higher precedence then ++, so 1 is assigned to i. After that address stored in p is incremented by 1. Now p is pointing to second element of num i.e. 4.

So, finally:
*p is 4
*q is 8
i is 1
